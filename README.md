# ReloKmeans
Developing an improvement to Repeated Kmeans. A group project in the course TDT4173 Machine Learning

Readme equivalent is found in ReloKmeans.ipynb file, created in google colab.

NOTE: Data folder has to be accessible from the notebook running the code. A way of ensuring this is to download the data locally and upload it in the VM created by google colab (click folder icon on left hand side in the notebook, you could upload the data into the sample_data folder, for instance). Then make sure to update path variable used in 1. Data code block by copy pasting path (right click data folder on left hand side in google colab and copy path).
Another option is to upload the data to your personal google drive and connect to that folder by uncommenting the first line in the 1. Data code block: drive.mount(/content/gdrive)
