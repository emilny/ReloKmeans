To understand why this has to be done, imagine the initial clustering having CI=9, i.e. 9 misplaced centroids. If `n=4`, three relocation steps would most likely be executed, the last step \"overshooting\" by 3 (CI would most likely take on values 9, 5, 1, 3), and the returned result would have a CI value of 1. Instead, the algorithm re-runs on the returned clustering with `n=1`, likely performing two relocation steps (CI taking on values 1, 0, 1) before returning the result with CI=0. "
